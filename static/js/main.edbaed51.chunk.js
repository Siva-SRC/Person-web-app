He is best known as the founder, CEO, and president of the multi-national technology company Amazon. The first centi-billionaire on the Forbes wealth index,[3] Bezos has been the world's richest person since 2017 and was named the \"richest man in modern history\" after his net worth increased to $150 billion in July 2018.[4] According to Forbes, Bezos is the first person in history to have a net worth exceeding $200 billion.[5] Born in Albuquerque and raised in Houston and later Miami, Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986. Bezos holds a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. Bezos founded Amazon in late 1994 on a cross-country road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a wide variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is currently the world's largest online sales company, the largest Internet company by revenue, and the world's largest provider of virtual assistants[6] and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services branch. Bezos founded the aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue Origin in 2000. Blue Origin's New Shepard vehicle reached space in 2015, and afterwards successfully landed back on Earth. The company has upcoming plans to begin commercial suborbital human spaceflight.[7] He also purchased the major American newspaper The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million, and manages many other investments through his Bezos Expeditions venture capital firm.",Object(i.jsx)("i",{children:"For more information"})," ",Object(i.jsx)("a",{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos",target:"blank",children:"Click here"})]})]})}t(36);function p(e){return Object(i.jsxs)("div",{id:"billGates",children:[Object(i.jsx)(m.a,{onClick:function(){window.location="/"},className:"faIcon",icon:u.a,title:"click to go to home page"}),Object(i.jsx)("h1",{children:"Bill Gates"}),Object(i.jsx)("img",{src:"https://media.wired.com/photos/5f2c4e757055a2aa4e463797/16:9/w_2399,h_1349,c_limit/Science_BillGates_1174744356.jpg",alt:""}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(i.jsx)("strong",{children:"William Henry Gates III "})," (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer, and philanthropist. He is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation.[2][3] During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Gates co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975, in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it went on to become the world's largest personal computer software company.[4][a] Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect.[7] During the late 1990s, Gates had been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[8] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000.[9] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[10] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[11] In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic endeavors including climate change, global health and development, and education.[12] Since 1987, he has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[13][14] From 1995 to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years.[15] In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time.[16] As of August 2020, Gates had an estimated net worth of US$113.7 billion, making him the second-wealthiest person in the world, behind Bezos.[17][b] Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He has given sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity.[19] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[20]",Object(i.jsx)("i",{children:"For more information"})," ",Object(i.jsx)("a",{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates",target:"blank",children:"Click here"})]})]})}t(37);var f=function(){return Object(i.jsxs)("div",{id:"markZuckerberg",children:[Object(i.jsx)(m.a,{onClick:function(){window.location="/"},className:"faIcon",icon:u.a,title:"click to go to home page"}),Object(i.jsx)("h1",{children:"Mark Zuckerberg"}),Object(i.jsx)("img",{src:"https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_45/2456801/180606-mark-zuckerberg-se-3221p_bb99e5f9cd63bddb4392bf22625a2998.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.JPG",alt:""}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(i.jsx)("strong",{children:"Mark Elliot Zuckerberg"}),"(/\u02c8z\u028ck\u0259rb\u025c\u02d0r\u0261/; born May 14, 1984) is an American media magnate, internet entrepreneur, and philanthropist.

Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. As of November 2020, Zuckerberg's net worth is $96.7 billion,[7] making him the 4th-richest person in the world.[8] He is the only person under 40-years-old in Forbes' list of the 20 richest people.[9] Since 2010, Time magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 most influential people in the world as a part of its Person of the Year award.[10][11][12] In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked 10th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People.[13]",Object(i.jsx)("i",{children:"For more information"})," ",Object(i.jsx)("a",{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg",target:"blank",children:"Click here"})]})]})};t(38);var g=function(){return Object(i.jsxs)("div",{id:"markZuckerberg",children:[Object(i.jsx)(m.a,{onClick:function(){window.location="/"},className:"faIcon",icon:u.a,title:"click to go to home page"}),Object(i.jsx)("h1",{children:"Bernard Arnault & family"}),Object(i.jsx)("img",{src:"https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2019/03/06/ad902f24-3e40-11e9-b20a-0cdc8de4a6f4_1320x770_162134.JPG",alt:""}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(i.jsx)("strong",{children:"Bernard Jean \xc9tienne Arnault"})," (French: [b\u025b\u0281na\u0281 \u0292\u0251\u0303 etj\u025bn a\u0281no]; born 5 March 1949) is a French billionaire businessman and art collector.[2][3] He is the chairman and chief executive of LVMH Mo\xebt Hennessy \u2013 Louis Vuitton SE, the world's largest luxury-goods company.
